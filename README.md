# Reds Hackathon 2025

battersData.Rmd and pitchersData.Rmd take batter and pitcher-relevant columns respectively and modify, wrangle, create, combine, and pivot them into the full set of predictors available from the data. playersData.Rmd then combines these two sets of predictors into one and attaches the lahman data as well. allDataWrangling.Rmd is a comprehensive document with all of this information cleaned up to be nice and pretty and easily followed. regression.Rmd is a very haphazard document of all of our fitted regression models, model selection processes, and model validation processes, finalRegression.Rmd is our cleaned-up look at the final model we chose, how we chose it, how we validated it, and how we implemented it. redsNotebook.html is our final submission notebook for Kaggle with visuals included.
